# given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height

# a binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node firts a specific ordering property:
# - all left nodes are less that the parent, n
# - all right nodes are greater than the parent, n
# - each node in the tree can take on the value of n

# hint:1
# a minimal binary tree has about the same number of nodes as the left of each node as the right node
# let's focus on just the root for now
# how would you ensure that about the same number of nodes are on the left as the right?
